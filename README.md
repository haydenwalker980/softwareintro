fuck yeah (:< my files are shared!  
cool dog OS is an OS made to make your computer faster and more reliable.  
It is based of ubuntu 19.10 to make it more stable.  
every update we update it based on a LTS based version of ubuntu to make it be supported longer.  
we based it of ubuntu 19.10 because 20.04 is only new and it is less stable.. I recomend waiting for a future update because a beta build is not stable and you will experience bugs and other problems

## How to play windows games
download linux, wine, and steam and play on linux, ETC
if you want to read more you can read it at the zorin os website since it is based of ubuntu.

coming november 2nd

When it is out we will make an image on what it looks like so users coming from mac OS or windows 10 8.1 7 ETC will know how it looks so they can decide if they're used to it or NOT.
